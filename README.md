# Task Nr.2

The program is required to be divided into modules i.e.: each class is described in a header file, methods are realized in the implementation file (except for abstract classes that donâ€™t have implementation).

In classes, data are encapsulated, i.e. all data is private or protected, and the functions are public only those that are needed.

No graphical user interface is required - all output and input can be done via standard console input and output functions. Use only C ++ stream functions for input / output operations.

Comments should be written in the program to make it easier for the teacher to understand and evaluate correctly.
